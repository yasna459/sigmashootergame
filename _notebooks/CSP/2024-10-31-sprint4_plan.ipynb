    "## Sprint Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breaking out your own Social Media Project**:\n",
    "   - Objective is to create something that belongs to you and could potentially lead to your CPT project.\n",
    "   - There will only be one person with rights to pull code into the repository.\n",
    "   - Teams will be 3 people, tables will be 6 people.\n",
    "   - We will plan leadership off of one Scrum Master and Integrator per 6 people.\n",
    "   - Teams of 3 will have very distinct features.\n",
    "   - This work will require coordination and design.\n",
    "   - There will be frequent checkpoints.\n",
    "   - The first checkpoints will show that you are meeting Big Idea 1.1 to 1.3 requirements in planning, coordination, as well as meeting all the requirements for CPT.\n",
    "   - Read the CPT requirements and start a planning breakdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extending ideas for your group Social Media Project**:\n",
    "   - Your project should have designs for signup, login, and your social media features and actions.\n",
    "   - Each person in the team will have a clear path and design for full stack responsibility.\n",
    "   - Additional areas of consideration that must be considered:\n",
    "     - Jinja MVC [admin menu](https://flask2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/login?next=/users/table2)\n",
    "     - Home Page [design](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/flocker_frontend/)\n",
    "     - Additional features mentioned below for an \"A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Teaching Elements**:\n",
    "   - There are teaching elements we will focus on in Big Ideas 1, 2, 4, and the remaining sections of Big Idea 3.\n",
    "   - Selection of these elements could impact a mandatory CompSci social media section to your Social Media project.\n",
    "   - References to assist can be found on [Time Box Page](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher_portfolio/navigation/csp)."
