    "## Sprint Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Team Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Objective for Sprint 5**\n",
    "     - **Feature Ready Milestone**: Iterate on a project so that it is feature-ready for Team and Individual CPT requirements.\n",
    "     - **Database Functionality**: Ensure that data used in the system is persistent and dynamic.\n",
    "     - **Deployment**: Ensure backend and database are public and available for group updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Issues/Project Management**\n",
    "      - **Team Issue**: Define the project purpose and key features. Form an issue to serve as a burndown list. The Team Issue will be used in Team Live reviews and retrospectives.\n",
    "      - **Individual Issue**: Describe feature purpose and progress toward CPT requirements. The Individual Issue is a burndown list and will be used in Group and Individual reviews.\n",
    "      - **Kanban Board**: Contain Team or Individual burndown items. Issues are used to grow the project in iterative increments. One or more issues are used to support the burndown of Team and Individual Issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Team Organization**\n",
    "     - **Team Size**: As close to 6 people as possible.\n",
    "     - **Leadership**: One Scrum Master, and one assistant/backup Scrum Master.\n",
    "     - **Integrations**: Two people with rights to pull code into the repository.\n",
    "     - **Deployment Admins**: Two people with rights to deploy.\n",
    "     - **Visual Design**: One person to maintain front-end design documentation.\n",
    "     - **Data Modeler**: One person to maintain backend data definition documentation.\n",
    "     - **Coders**: Everyone will have frontend and backend coding responsibilities for their personal end-to-end feature.\n",
    "     - **Multiple Roles/Hats**: You will likely have multiple jobs and coding responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Classroom Reviews**\n",
    "     - **Groups/Individual**: Reviews will always be 3 people.\n",
    "       - **Individual Issue and Kanban Issue(s)**: Show leveraged and distinct features. Highly focused on code and data updates.\n",
    "       - **Expectation**: This review will clearly show distinct coding on frontend and backend features. Burndown of CPT features highlights CPT questionnaire/writeup.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Team/Table**: Reviews will be 6 people.\n",
    "       - **Team Issue and Kanban**: Show coordinated progress on Team Goals. Highly focused on demo and functionality.\n",
    "       - **Expectation**: Requires coordination and design.\n",
    "     - There will be frequent checkpoints: team, individual, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extending Flocker Social Media Project**:\n",
    "   - Your project should have designs for signup, login, and your social media features and actions.  These feature were provided as starters.\n",
    "   - Additional areas of consideration:\n",
    "     - Python/Jinja MVC [admin menu](https://flask2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/login?next=/users/table2)\n",
    "     - Javascript Frontend [home page](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/flocker_frontend/) a personalized redesign of flocker and its navigation.\n",
    "     - Database.  Extending provided database to capture information from key individual features in the web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Teaching Elements**:\n",
    "   - There are distinct elements on Big Ideas 1, 2, 3, 4 in your project. Consider how you will capture these elements in your personal blog to aid in your review and study.\n",
    "   - We will have an MCQ test in this Sprint to help support your personal blog build-up and College Board MCQ preparation."
