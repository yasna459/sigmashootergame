    "## Designing with Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "The Single Responsibility Principle is a programming concept that states that a class or method should have only one reason to change. This means that a class or method should only have one job or responsibility. This principle is part of the SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class design.  SRP helps to keep the code more maintainable and understandable. When classes have more than one responsibility, they can become complex and can be harder to understand, maintain, and change. By ensuring that each class has only one responsibility, we can keep our code clean, organized, and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Method design.  In game development, it's crucial to keep code as simple and clear as possible using SRP. Games often involve complex systems interacting with each other, and having clear, single-purpose methods can make it easier to understand how these systems work together. It also makes it easier to isolate and fix bugs, as each method is responsible for one thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The importance of single purpose classes and methods in game development\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Easier debugging and testing. When each class and method has a single responsibility, it's easier to write tests for them and to debug them when things go wrong. You can focus on testing one specific functionality at a time, and if a test fails, you know exactly where to look for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - More readable and maintainable code. Code that follows the SRP is generally more readable and easier to maintain. Each class and method does one thing, so it's easier to understand what each part of the code is supposed to do. This makes it easier for other developers to understand your code, and it makes it easier for you to understand and update your code in the future."

    "## The role of SRP in game Design \n",
    "Code complexity without Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) can quickly become unreadable and changes can become daunting.  Code with SRP more clearly illustrates code flow and order of operations.\n",

    "In this example, we will follow OOP design and SRP principles by tracking the update process in the game.\n",

    "### GameEnv Update\n",
    "Here is an example of SRP design pattern showing gameObject.update() method that is called within the GameLoop, the GameEnv update() is called from the GameControl gameLoop(). \n",

    "This gameObject.update() method call, using SRP principle, is distinct from the gameObject.serialize() method and the gameObject.draw() method. Read the descriptions of the static update() method calls...\n",

    "- updateY(). Handles y axis updates, primarily related to gravity simulation.\n",
