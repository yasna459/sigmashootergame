## Introduction
> What is Full Stack?
- A full stack feature in software development refers to a feature or functionality that spans both the **front end** (client side) and the **back end** (server side) of an application. 
- This means that the feature includes everything from the **user interface** and user experience (what the user sees and interacts with) to the **server**, **database**, and **logic** that make the feature work behind the scenes.
- The components or stack of this feature are usually as follows
1. **Frontend**, the part that the user interacts with
2. **Backend**, the sever side of the feature, handling requests, interactions with the database
3. **Database**, Where the apps data is stored and managed
4. **API**, The Application Programming Interface allows the fronted to connect and communicate with backend

## Framework
- When creating the backend and frontend of your project you should have a clear answer to these two questions
1. What **data** will need to be stored for my feature to work, and what **endpoints** are needed for my feature?
2. What will the **wireframe** for my feature look like, and how will it be **auto-generated**?
- The questions above are what make your feature unique, no matter the feature there will always be a certain partition of the code that is the exact same
- If you're able to answer these questions above you will have no problem in seeing the vision of your feature

## How to answer the questions with your idea
- In these documents im going to be creating a announcement API, so I will be creating that when I talk about my own feature

1. Question #1
- For a announcement, I'm going to need an **ID** (standard in every database), **author**, **title**, **body**, **time**, and **tags** data
- For the endpoints think about how this data need's to be accessed besides the usual CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) methods, maybe a **fetch** by **author** or **tag**

2. Question #2
- **Search** for similar wireframes online on what to base your feature off of, maybe similar to how tweets look
- It will be auto generated by generating each announcement on top of each other with the most present at the top

### My example

<br>

| ID | Author | Title | Body | Timestamp | Tags |
| -- | ------ | ----- | ---- | --------- | ---- |
|    |        |       |      |           |      |

## My thoughts, why you should do this
> My thoughts on the matter
- The problem with fullstack development is no doubt the barrier entry in terms of knowledge that is needed
- Knowing how to create API's with specific endpoints, or self generating javascript wireframes, it seems like an impossible tasks, much easier to do one or even none of what i listed
- Through my experience in the Nighthawk CS route I found that most slackers in groups came from a place of self dismissal "I can't do this", "Im never gonna understand this"
- My goal from these blog posts is to make this development as simple as can be, by taking you through these steps
- Hopefully if you follow the steps of this notebook, you will be able to use this as a reference for the creation of your'e own features
