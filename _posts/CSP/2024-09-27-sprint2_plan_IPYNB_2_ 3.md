## Home Page, Blog, and Issue
Teacher and Peer evaluation are critical to our success and improvements.  

1. The Home Page on your personal Blog should be a place to discuss your projects and progress.
2. Be sure to share your progress through Big Idea 3 by updating you Blog.
3. Class Presentations by Lesson and by Comprehension solidfy our study.
3. Issues can be used to showcase meeting objective and recive feedback through Utterance Comments.

## Student Teaching - Part 1 Fundamentals Blog

Students will engage in lesson preparation, teaching, and grading. This activity is often called "Team Teach". The process and purpose are as follows:

1. Learn Big Idea 3 from the College Board.
2. Build a lesson using Python and JavaScript for each of the programming fundamentals provided by the teacher's starters.
3. The lesson should include a Tech Talk portion, popcorn hacks, and homework hacks. The lesson should NOT have more than 5 minutes of talking before engaging students in an activity (e.g., popcorn hacks).
4. Be prepared to grade homework. This means having a plan for homework and a plan for grading the homework. You will grade on a "1-point" scale. Weight popcorn hacks and homework hacks in the grading.
5. Lesson time will be between 20 and 30 minutes. Homework time should be about the same as lesson time.

### Lesson Review - Topic Relevancy (Stdent Review)

Peer review checklist.  Guideance

- Scurm Master should coordinate.

- Peer grading should be coordinated in Slack, if there are any issues.

- Lesson providers will receive reviews from a peers in another class, doing the same topic, by enabling Utterances on your topic(s).

- Peer graders will grade on Utterances.  Be sure two people provide a review to every section of lesson (ie 2 reviews on intro, 2 reviews on .1, 2 reviews on .2, ...).  

- Assingments are to review corresponding topics in other classes.
  - P1 reviews P2
  - P2 reviews P3 
  - P3 reviews P4
  - P4 reviews P5 
  - P5 reviews P1

Note 1. **The purpose is NOT MORPH lessons to be the same, boring!!!**
Note 2. **Student reviewers will be evaluated on how and if you perform a review** 
Note 3. **Student lesson providers will be evaluated if the improve lesson based off of feedback.  Remebmer/document your changes**

## Enrichment Presentation to Class

Every individual will talk for 2 minutes in front of the class about why the Sprint 2, BI Unit 3 lessons, and self-study final were impactful. The focus should be on how you were enriched in both technical and soft skills.

### Guideline
This is a guideline of focus; consider these 4 things when you talk individually:

- **Blog**: In association with Big Ideas and Teaching, discuss something that shows how you will be prepared for CB and PBL activities in the future (e.g., an organized checklist of accomplishments).
- **Memory**: Consider something that will help the teacher and fellow students recall your individual presentation and contribution (e.g., a highlight of your lesson).
- **Relevancy**: Describe something impactful you learned from another lesson, note the source, and try to use the relevancy checklist language in your discussion (e.g., a learning experience).
- **Beyond Perfunctory**: Inform listeners of something that shows them that this Sprint on Big Idea 3 is distinctly yours (e.g., personal growth or accomplishment).

## Sprint 2 Big Idea 3 Final

Every student need to update their blog to be reflective of accomplishments and learning from Sprint 1 and Sprint 2.  This will be focus of Live Review.

1. **Sprint 1**: As we move to Project-based Learning task the Teacher needs to be convinced all tools are working.  The most important things to certify:  VSCode localhost build, GitHub Pages github.io link, Analytics, VSCode roll forward/roll back.

2. **Sprint 2**: Using the Final Hack or similar, show teacher as single place that all the BI Unit 3 elements come together.  The expectation is something visual and in JavaScript.

3. **Home Page**: Using Nighthawk Pages blogging style update your home page to be reflective of your year long progress in the class.
