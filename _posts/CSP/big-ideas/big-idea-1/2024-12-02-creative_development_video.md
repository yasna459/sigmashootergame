## Make a Video as a Team

Test will be conducted by creating a video.  Make sure video has segments with transition pages.  Have each member of Agile Team in at least 1 segment.  Edit video effectively and try to keep it under 4 minutes.  The video can instruct user to pause and interact with a Jupyter Notebook, this does not count against video time.

### Collaboration Review

It is a common belief in industry that collaboration is one of the key skills of a Software Engineer.  Simple activities like think-pair-share, scrum agile methodolgoy, and making and reviewing plans are consider fundamental in speeding up the development life cycle.  An Agile mindset and checking in with other often is fundamental.  Remember, "collaboration" is the 1st topic in AP Classroom, first usually means important.

- [ ] What are the benefits of a team?  Explain some of the diveristies that your team has to offer.
- [ ] Describe how you will facilitate communication amongst group members.  Suggestion using scrum agile methodology.
- [ ] How will you hold each person accountable for their portion of the work?  Think about dates, review tickets, and peer reviews using a Kanban board.

### Program Function and Purpose

To "make" a program with function and purpose, you need to "plan" a program with function and purpose.  Build a Jupyter Notebook to show examples of the following from your project.

- [ ] Program with Output
- [ ] Program with Input and Output
- [ ] Program with a List
- [ ] Program with a Dictionary
- [ ] Program with Iteration
- [ ] Program with a Function to perform mathematical and/or a statistical calculations.
- [ ] Program with a Selection/Condition
- [ ] Finish with a Program with Purpose

### Program Design and Development

Share a program that you have expanded upon that was written by another, for instance started in Flocker.  Show extensive documentation on that program (ie use ChatGPT for help).  Here are some minimum requirements for Design and Development documentation.

- [ ] Create a Visual Illustration of a program, algorithm, or process. User stories can help.
- [ ] Show documentation of a program with a List and Iteration.
- [ ] Show comments on a program, including something that does a mathematical and/or statistical calculation.

### Identyfing and Correct Errors

Often, when we develop code the initial functionality is very simple.  However, when we consider invalid conditions when using our code we often increase the complexity of our code or functions.

- [ ] Create a tester function that runs a program that create data for testing.
- [ ] Show comments and code logic that captures conditions if a user errors in input with if / else statements.
- [ ] Show comments and code logic that handles error conditions in code if data or database fails, for example try / catch statements.
- [ ] Illustrate a debugging session using inspect in browser on frontend.
- [ ] Illustrate a debugging session that uses Postman and VS Code to debug backend.
