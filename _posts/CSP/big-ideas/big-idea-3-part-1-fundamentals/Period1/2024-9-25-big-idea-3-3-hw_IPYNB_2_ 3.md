<h1>Homework Hacks ðŸ“•</h1>
Review the instructions and examples in the lesson and create a function that will produce a certain term in the fibonacci sequence that is inputted as well as one that can find the area of a circle, square, and a rectangle by asking for input on what the shape is, and what the value(s) are that are needed to calculate the area of the shape. 

Challenge: Add one that can do the volume of rectangluar prisms, spheres, and pyramids.

Formulas:

- Volume of rectangluar prism is base x width x height
- Volume of sphere is 4/3 x pi x r cubed
- Volume of pyramid is 1/3 x base x width x height
