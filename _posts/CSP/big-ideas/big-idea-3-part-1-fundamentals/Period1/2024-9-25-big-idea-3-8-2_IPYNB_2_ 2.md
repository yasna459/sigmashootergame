Create a program that asks the user for a number and keeps asking until they enter a positive number.

Requirements:
1. Input Validation: Make sure that the input is actually a number. Display an 'error' message if the user inputted something that is NOT a number
2. Positive Checker: If the user has entered a number that is positive, print a 'success!' message with the entered number
3. If the user has entered a number that is not positive like zero or a negative number, print a 'try again' message, prompting them to keep inputting numbers till they input a positive number.
