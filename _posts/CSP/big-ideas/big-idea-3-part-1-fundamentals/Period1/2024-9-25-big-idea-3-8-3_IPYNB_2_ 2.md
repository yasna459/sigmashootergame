```python
# Ticket pricing system
base_ticket_price = 10.00

# Get the user's age
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

# Determine ticket price based on age
if age <= 12:
    ticket_price = base_ticket_price * 0.5  # 50% off for children
    print(f"Child ticket price: ${ticket_price:.2f}")
elif age <= 63:
    ticket_price = base_ticket_price  # Full price for adults
    print(f"Adult ticket price: ${ticket_price:.2f}")
else:
    ticket_price = base_ticket_price * 0.7  # 30% off for seniors
    print(f"Senior ticket price: ${ticket_price:.2f}")

# Check if the user has a ticket
has_ticket = input("Do you have a ticket? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"

if has_ticket:
    # Check if the user is a student
    while True:
        is_student = input("Are you a student? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if is_student == "yes":
            student_discount = 0.20  # 20% discount
            final_price = ticket_price * (1 - student_discount)
            print(f"You are eligible for a student discount! The ticket price is now: ${final_price:.2f}")
            break
        elif is_student == "no":
            print(f"No student discount applied. The ticket price is: ${ticket_price:.2f}")
            break
        else:
            print('Invalid response. Please answer with "yes" or "no".')
else:
    print("You need a ticket to enter.")

# Answer to Popcorn Hack 2:
- take note of use of else statement to ensure you check for even/odd AFTER satisfying operation
- modulo ( % ) operator 


```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Code that might raise an exception
    result = 10 / num  # Could raise ZeroDivisionError if num is 0
    print("Result:", result)
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
else:
    # This block runs if no exception occurs
    print("Operation was successful!")
    
    # Check if the number is even or odd
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"The number {num} is even.")
    else:
        print(f"The number {num} is odd.")

```
