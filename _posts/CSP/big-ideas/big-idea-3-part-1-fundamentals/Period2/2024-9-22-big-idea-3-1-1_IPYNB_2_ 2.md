## Big Idea 3.1: Variables and Assignments

Learn how variables are used in programs to simplify more complex problems

### Lesson 

1. **Variables**:
   - What are variables?

2. **Varaible Naming**:
   - SnakeCase
   - PascalCase
   - CamelCase
   - Putting it all to together

3. **Variable Types**:
   - Integers
   - Strings
   - Boolean
   - Float
   - Lists
   - Dictionaries In Pyhton

4. **Operators on string**
   - (+)
   - (*)

## Variables

**Variables**

Variables ae used to store some kind of data in program that can be referenced elsewhere (Often more than once)


```python
# Variables

name = "Akshaj"
age = "15 years old"
Grade = "10th grade"

print (name)
print (age) 
print (name, age)

```

    Akshaj
    15 years old
    Akshaj 15 years old


**These variables are used to simplify code. Instead of reapeting the staement 15 years old. Everytime I want to refer to it, I just use the variable "age"**

## Variable Naming

**Variable Naming goes over the different ways people like to name their variables. These are based on personal preferences. But their are 3 common ones used amongst all the coders. This is to prevent any confusion when collaborating**

### Snake Case
Snake case is when you place an underscore (_) between the the two words in the variable name. This underscore is to replace the space betweent the words


```python
# SnakeCase

Scrum_Master = "Arhaan"
print(Scrum_Master)

num_1 = 34
print(num_1)
```

    Arhaan
    34


### Pascal Case
In Pascal Case, The coder capitalizes the first letter of every word in the variable name. There are no spaces between the words


```python
# PascalCase

ScrumMaster = "Arhaan"
print(ScrumMaster)

TeamLeader = "Akshaj"
print(TeamLeader)
```

    Arhaan
    Akshaj


### CamelCase
**In CamelCase, The coder capitalizes the first letter of the second word of the variable name. This continue onward for every subsequent word**


```python
# CamelCase
scrumMaster = "Arhaan"
print(scrumMaster)

teamLeader = "Akshaj"
print(teamLeader)
```

    Arhaan
    Akshaj


### Putting it all together
**Even though these are different ways to annotate your variables, they work together to support different purposes in code.

### Naming Conventions in Python

**snake_case**: Used for variable names, function names, and method names.
- Example: my_variable, calculate_sum(), get_user_input().

**PascalCase**: Used for class names.
- Example: MyClass, UserProfile, DataProcessor.

**CAPS_SNAKE_CASE**: Used for constants.
- Example: MAX_CONNECTIONS, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, PI.


```python
# Popcorn Hack
# Even though all these work, which of these is standard for Python?

Scrum_Master = "Arhaan"
GroupMaster = "Akshaj"
groupMember = "Mihir"
unkown_member = "Unknown"

print (Scrum_Master, GroupMaster, groupMember, unkown_member)
```

    Arhaan Akshaj Mihir Unknown


## Variable Types

### Integers
**Integers are when numerical whole numbers, both positive and negative are assigned with a variable name. This variable can be called upon later on**


```python
# Integers

a = 45
b = -11
c = 0 

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
```

    45
    -11
    0


### Strings
**When phrases or sentences are assigned a variable name, that can be called upon later**




```python
# Strings

Joke = "Why did the two Java methods get a divorce?"
Answer = "Because they had constant arguments."

print (Joke)
print (Answer)
```

    Why did the two Java methods get a divorce?
    Because they had constant arguments.


### Boolean
**Booleans are true or false statements. You state if if the statement is true of false. You assign a result if it's true, also a assigned result if it's false.**


```python
# Boolean

is_student = True

if is_student:
    print("You are a student.")
else:
    print("You are not a student.")


```

    You are a student.


### Float
**Floats are numbers that aren't integers and also have decimals within the assigned value**


```python
# Float

e = 2.712828

print(e)
```

    2.712828


### Lists
**When a bunch of numbers or phrases are grouped together, and represented by one list variable**


```python
# Lists

group_members = ["Akshaj", "Arhaan", "Mihir", "Keirthan"]
print(group_members)
print(group_members[3])
```

    ['Akshaj', 'Arhaan', 'Mihir', 'Keirthan']
    Keirthan


### Dictionaries In Python
**In Python, dictionaries are flexible data structures that hold key-value pairs. Because every value in a dictionary has a distinct key, efficient value lookups and retrievals are possible. They are kinda similar to lists**


```python
#Dictionaries In Python

student_info = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 19,
    "grade": "11th",
    "favorite_sports": ["Golf", "Soccer"]
}

print(student_info["name"])
print(student_info["age"])
print(student_info["favorite_sports"])   
```

    John
    19
    ['Golf', 'Soccer']


## Operators
**Operators such as (+) & (*) work with phrases. While many more operators apply on integers**


```python
#Operators

n = "my name is "
name = "John"

print (n+name)
print (name * 10)

# With Integers

n_1 = 2
n_2 = 3
n_3 = 4
n_4 = 5
n_5 = 3.141

# all those symbols basicailly work the way we use them in math except (//)

# When you 8 // 3 = It divides it and then rounds down to the nearest whole number
print (n_1 + n_2)
print (n_2 - n_1)
print (n_3 * n_4)
print (n_3 / n_1)
print (n_4 // n_1)
print (n_5 * n_2)
print (n_4 % n_1)
```

    my name is John
    JohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohn
    5
    1
    20
    2.0
    2
    9.423
