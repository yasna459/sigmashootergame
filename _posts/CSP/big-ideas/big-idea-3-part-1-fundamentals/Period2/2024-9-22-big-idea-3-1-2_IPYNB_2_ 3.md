## JavaScript Variables and Data Types

In this notebook, we will explore different types of variables and data types used in JavaScript. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables do not need to be explicitly declared with a type. The type of the variable is determined by the value assigned to it.

### Types of Variables in JavaScript:
- `var`: Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- `let`: Declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- `const`: Declares a block-scoped, read-only constant.

### Data Types in JavaScript:
- Primitive Data Types:
  - `String`
  - `Number`
  - `Boolean`
  - `Null`
  - `Undefined`
  - `Symbol`
- Non-primitive Data Types:
  - `Object`
  - `Array`
  - `Function`

## Naming convention in JavaScript
The convention in JavaScript is different in Python on its use of **camelCase for variables**, functions, and mehods;  verus Python usage of snake_case.

- **camelCase** is used for variables, functions, and methods.
- **PascalCase** is used for class names and constructor functions.
- **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** is used for constants.

## Strings in JavaScript

A **string** in JavaScript is used to represent textual data. Strings are created by enclosing characters within quotes (single or double quotes).

### Example:
In this example, we will declare a string variable and print it to the console.



```python
%%js
// 1. Strings
let name = "Arhaan";
console.log("String: ", name);
element.append("String: " + name + "<br>");
```

## Numbers in JavaScript

JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals. They can be integers or floating-point numbers.

### Example:
In this example, we will declare a number variable and print it to the console.



```python
%%js
let age = 25;
let height = 5.9;
console.log(age);   // Output: 25
console.log(height); // Output: 5.9


```

## Booleans in JavaScript

A **boolean** represents one of two values: `true` or `false`. Booleans are typically used for logical operations.

### Example:
In this example, we will declare a boolean variable and print it to the console.



```python
%%js
let isStudent = true;
let isGraduate = false;
console.log(isStudent);  // Output: true
console.log(isGraduate);  // Output: false


```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


## Undefined in JavaScript

A variable in JavaScript that has been declared but not assigned a value has the value `undefined`.

### Example:
In this example, we will declare an undefined variable and print its value.



```python
%%js
// 4. Undefined
let uninitialized;
console.log(uninitialized); // Output: undefined


```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


## Null in JavaScript

The `null` value represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable should not contain any value.

### Example:
In this example, we will declare a null variable and print its value.



```python
%%js
let emptyValue = null;
console.log(emptyValue); // Output: null


```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


## Symbol

A unique and immutable data type used primarily as object property keys.




```python
%%js
// Creating a unique Symbol
let uniqueId = Symbol('id');

// Outputting the Symbol
console.log(uniqueId); // Output: Symbol(id)



```

## Arrays and Objects in JavaScript

### Arrays:
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Each value is called an element, and arrays can store values of any type.

### Objects:
Objects are collections of key-value pairs where each key (also called a property) is associated with a value. Objects are the most important data type in JavaScript. They are also called **JSON Objects** and are similart to Python dictionaries.

### Example:
In this example, we will declare an array and an object and print them to the console.



```python
%%js

//Arrays
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors); // Output: ['red', 'green', 'blue']

//objects
let person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 25,
    isStudent: true
};
console.log(person); // Output: { name: 'John Doe', age: 25, isStudent: true }

//fumction 
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!


```
