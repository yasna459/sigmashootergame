# **Python Homework: Shopping List Calculator**

## Objective

In this assignment, you will create a simple shopping list calculator that allows users to add items to their shopping list, input their prices, and calculate the total cost. 

---

## **Assignment Steps**

### Step 1: Initialize Your Shopping List

1. Create an empty list to store the items in the shopping list.
2. Create a variable to store the total cost, initialized to zero.

### Step 2: User Input for Shopping List

Implement a loop that allows users to add items to their shopping list until they decide to stop. For each item, ask the user to input:
- The name of the item
- The price of the item

### Example (Python):
```python
shopping_list = []
total_cost = 0.0

while True:
    item_name = input("Enter the item name (or 'done' to finish): ")
    if item_name.lower() == 'done':
        break
    item_price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: "))
    
    shopping_list.append((item_name, item_price))
    total_cost += item_price


# Javascript Homework: Recipe Ingredient Converter

### Objective:
In this assignment, you will create a simple recipe ingredient converter that allows users to input ingredient quantities in one unit and convert them to another unit (e.g., cups to tablespoons). 

### Assignment Steps:

#### Step 1: Initialize Conversion Rates
- Create variables for common conversion rates. For example:
  - 1 cup = 16 tablespoons
  - 1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons
  - 1 cup = 48 teaspoons

#### Step 2:  Input for Ingredients
- Implement a loop that allows users to input ingredient quantities until they decide to stop. For each ingredient, ask the user to input:
  - The name of the ingredient
  - The quantity of the ingredient
  - The current unit (e.g., cups, tablespoons, teaspoons)

#### Step 3: Conversion Logic
- Based on the unit provided, convert the quantity to the desired unit. For example:
  - If the user inputs cups, convert to tablespoons or teaspoons.
  - Provide an option for the user to specify the desired conversion unit.

#### Step 4: Display the Converted Results
- After the user has finished inputting ingredients, print out the original quantities along with the converted values.


### Example:
1. If the user inputs:
   - **Ingredient**: Sugar
   - **Quantity**: 2
   - **Unit**: Cups

2. The program should convert this to:
   - 32 tablespoons or 96 teaspoons.
