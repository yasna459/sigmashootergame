<span style="color: #4A7C2E; font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;"> .Lists</span>

<span style="color: #4A7C2E;">In Python, lists are containers which can store various types of data. They are ordered, meaning they are arranged in a numbered sequence starting at 0 (first element is 0th element), and are mutable, which means we can change the data in a list.</span>



```python
# Creating an empty list

mylist = []
```


```python
# apple is 0th element, orange is 1st, and banana is second
mylist = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

print(mylist)
```

    ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']


 <span style="color: #4A7C2E; font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">List Manipulation</span>

<span style="color: #4A7C2E;">We can use many different operations on a table just like how you use mathematical operations on numbers.</span>

<span style="color: #4A7C2E;">In Python, some of these operations include:</span>
<ul style="color: #4A7C2E;">
    <li>Indexing: accessing a list item through its index, or position in the list</li>
    <li>Assigning: assigning new values to list through referencing indices</li>
    <li>Inserting: adding new values to a list without overwriting existing ones (sometimes pushes other values up an index)</li>
    <li>Appending: adding values to the end of a list</li>
    <li>Removing: delete values by index, sometimes causing other values to move down in list</li>
    <li>Length: find how many values are in a list</li>
</ul>



```python
# Indexing
# Values in a table can be accessing using the list[index] format, where 'list' is your list name and 'index' is the numeric position of your data value in the list
mylist = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

print(mylist[0])
print(mylist[1])
```

    apple
    orange



```python
# Assigning values
# We can assign values by taking the list at a certain index and setting that to a new value
# You can also take list elements and assign them to another list

mylist = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
mylist2 = ["foo", "bar"]

mylist[2] = "watermelon"
mylist[1] = mylist2[0]

print(mylist)
```

    ['apple', 'foo', 'watermelon']



```python
# Inserting
# When inserting values, you use the .insert table method and specify the index and value you are inserting

mylist = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
mylist.insert(2,"watermelon")

print(mylist)
```

    ['apple', 'orange', 'watermelon', 'banana']



```python
# Appending
# Appending is just like inserting, but doesnt take an index parameter and will add your value to the end of the list

mylist = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
mylist.append("watermelon")

print(mylist)
```

    ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'watermelon']



```python
# Removing
# You can remove a value using .remove method, by giving an value that you want removed

mylist = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
mylist.remove("apple")

print(mylist)
```

    ['orange', 'banana']



```python
# Length
# len() function gives you the amount of elements in your list 

mylist = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

print(len(mylist))
```

    3



```python
# Iterating through a list using for loops
# Use the 'in' keyword while specifying an iterator variable 'fruit' for list

mylist = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]

for fruit in mylist:
    print(fruit)
```

    apple
    orange
    banana


<span style="color: #4A7C2E; font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;"> Homework</span>

<ul style="color: #4A7C2E;">
    <li>Create a Python script that starts out with a list containing various data values (type doesn't matter).</li>
    <li>Allow the user to input a number, check to see if the number corresponds to an existing index in the list.</li>
    <li>Remove the item at the given index from the list.</li>
</ul>
