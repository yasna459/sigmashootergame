## Popcorn Hack #1
Define three variables: Movie, Sport, Pet name


Combine these variables into the following message: Hello, my favorite movie is [Movie]. My favorite sport is [Sport] and my pet's name is [petName].


Do this exercise using both concatenation and interpolation


```python
%%js


let favoriteMovie = "Inception";
let favoriteSport = "soccer";
let petName = "Buddy";


// Concatenation
let concatenatedMessage = "My favorite movie is " + favoriteMovie + ". I love playing " + favoriteSport + " and my pet's name is " + petName + ".";


// Interpolation
let interpolatedMessage = `My favorite movie is ${favoriteMovie}. I love playing ${favoriteSport} and my pet's name is ${petName}.`;

```

## Popcorn Hack #2


You are given a string “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”. Your task is to write code that uses the slice() method to:

 - Extract the word “journey”
 - Extract the word “miles” using a negative starting index
 - Extract everything from the word “begins” to the end of the sentence
 - Output these extractions at the end of the code


```python
%%js


// Define string
let phrase = "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step";


// Extraction
let partOne = phrase.slice(2, 8);
let partTwo = phrase.slice(-18, -12);
let remainder = phrase.slice(20);


// Output
console.log(partOne);  // Output: journey
console.log(partTwo);  // Output: miles
console.log(remainder); // Output: begins with a single step
```

# Popcorn Hack #3 Removing Vowels


Write a function that takes a sentence as input and removes all the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from it, both uppercase and lowercase. The program should return the modified sentence.

Instructions:

Use a loop or list comprehension to filter out vowels.
Test it with sentences that contain both uppercase and lowercase vowels.


```python
def remove_vowels(input_str):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    result = ''.join([char for char in input_str if char not in vowels])
    return result

sentence = "I enjoy learning Python!"
print(remove_vowels(sentence))

```

## Reverse Order Hack

Take a sentence as input, then reverse the order of words, but not the characters within the words.

Instructions:

Split the sentence into words, reverse the word list, and then join them back into a string.
Try this with different sentences! 



```python
def reverse_words(input_str):
    words = input_str.split()
    reversed_words = " ".join(words[::-1])
    return reversed_words

sentence = "I love coding!"
print(reverse_words(sentence))

```

    coding! love I
