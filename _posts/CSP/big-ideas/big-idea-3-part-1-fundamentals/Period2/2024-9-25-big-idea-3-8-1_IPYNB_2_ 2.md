<span style="color: pink; font-size: 50px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> For Loops </span>
- A for loop is used in python for iterating over a sequence of code. 
- Through using a for loop, we can execute a set of commands that are in a list or set.
-  Here is an example


```python
vegetables = ["🥒", "🥑", "🥕"]
for x in vegetables:
  print(x)
```

    🥒
    🥑
    🥕


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Looping Through a String </span>
- Even strings are iterable objects and contain a sequence of characters 
- Here in an example


```python
for x in "avocado":
  print(x) 
```

    a
    v
    o
    c
    a
    d
    o


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> The Break Statement </span>
- A break statement can aid us in stopping a loop before it has loops all the items. 
- Here is an example


```python
vegetables = ["🥒", "🥑", "🥕"]
for x in vegetables:
  print(x)
  if x == "🥑":
    break
```

    🥒
    🥑


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> For Loops in Javascript </span>
- For Loops that are iterated over arrays can be in executed in Javascript in addition to Python.
- Here is an example


```javascript
%%javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
    console.log(fruits[i]);
}
```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 35px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Looping Through a String in Javascript </span>
- This Loop is used to help iterate through every character in the string but in javascript
- Here is an example 


```javascript
%%javascript
const str = "Hello, World!";

for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    console.log(str[i]);
}
```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Popcorn Hack #1 </span >
- This first hack is in Javascript and allows you to count from 0 to 4. 
- Through using this simple hack you can utilize for loops and create an array of numbers 


```javascript
%%javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Popcorn Hack #2 </span>
- The second hack is the use of code to make an array of fruits using Python
- Through this hack you can use minimal code to list your favorite things 


```python
fruits = ['🍎', '🍌', '🍒']

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

    🍎
    🍌
    🍒


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Homework </span>
- Try to add in two of the loops into your code, one in python and one in javascript. 
- This will help build your understanding on loops in both javascript and python 
- Additionally, try looping through a dictionary in order to be more creative with your code and personalize it


```python
person = {'name': 'Arshia', 'age': 16}

# Looping through keys
for key in person:
    print(key, person[key])

# Looping through values
for value in person.values():
    print(value)

# Looping through keys and values
for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, value)

```

    name Arshia
    age 16
    Arshia
    16
    name Arshia
    age 16
