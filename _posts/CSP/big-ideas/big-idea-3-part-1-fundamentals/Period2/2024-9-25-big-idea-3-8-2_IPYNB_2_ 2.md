<span style="color: pink; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> While Loops </span> <br>
A while loop is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 
The loop will continue to execute until the condition becomes false, at which point the loop terminates.

A working while loop has three key components: <br>
- Initialization of the loop control variable <br>
- Actions or operations performed within the loop <br>
- Update of the loop control variable to eventually meet the termination condition <br>

The loop evaluates the condition before each iteration, so if the condition is false at the start, the loop's body may never execute.

```python
# Initialize the control variable
number = 1

# While loop that runs as long as the counter is less than or equal to 5
while number <= 5:
    print("Number is:", number)
    
    # Update the control variable (increment by 1)
    number += 1

```

    Number is: 1
    Number is: 2
    Number is: 3
    Number is: 4
    Number is: 5

```python
%%js
let i = 10;  // Initialize a variable

while (i >= 0) {  // Condition: loop runs as long as i is greater than or equal to 0
    console.log("Countdown: " + i);  // Output the current value of i
    i--;  // Decrement the value of i
}

console.log("Liftoff!");  // Message after the loop completes

- Generates and prints all even numbers between 1 and 20.<br>
- It's a handy loop for quick number generation with minimal effort.


```python
number = 1

while number <= 20:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number)
    number += 1
```

    2
    4
    6
    8
    10
    12
    14
    16
    18
    20


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Do-While Loops</span> <br>
A control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once. It will continue to execute 
the block repeatedly, or stop, depending on a true/false condition evaluated at the end.

A working loop has three key components:<br>
- Actions or operations performed within the loop<br>
- Update of the loop control variable (flag)<br>
- Test expression to determine whether the loop continues or terminates


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 35px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Do-While Loop Using Python </span>


```python
# Initialize a variable
count = 0

while True:  # Infinite loop to mimic 'do'
    print("The count is:", count)
    count += 1  # Increment the count
    
    # Check condition at the end (like in a do-while loop)
    if count >= 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when the condition is met

```

    The count is: 0
    The count is: 1
    The count is: 2
    The count is: 3
    The count is: 4


<span style="color: pink; font-size: 35px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Do-While Loop Using Javascript </span>


```python
%%js

let count = 0;

do {
    console.log("The count is: " + count);
    count++;  // Increment the count
} while (count < 5);

console.log("Loop is done.");

- Simulates flipping a coin until it lands on "heads" using random generation.<br>
- Itâ€™s a simple hack to simulate random events.


```python
import random

flip = ""

while flip != "heads":
    flip = random.choice(["heads", "tails"])
    print(f"Flipped: {flip}")

print("Landed on heads!")
```

    Flipped: tails
    Flipped: tails
    Flipped: tails
    Flipped: tails
    Flipped: heads
    Landed on heads!

##### **Task 1: FizzBuzz with a Twist (while loop)**

Objective: Create a modified version of the classic FizzBuzz game using a while loop.

Print numbers from 1 to 50.<br>
For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.<br>
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.<br>
For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".<br>
Add a twist: for multiples of 7, print "Boom".<br>

**Challenge:** Change the range to numbers between 50 and 100 and modify the conditions to fit this new range (e.g., multiples of 4 instead of 3).

##### **Task 2: User Authentication System (do-while loop)**

Objective: Simulate a basic user login system with a do-while loop.

The user has 3 attempts to enter the correct username and password.<br>
After each failed attempt, display how many attempts are left.<br>
After 3 failed attempts, display a message saying the account is locked.<br>
Use a do-while loop to handle the login process, prompting the user for their credentials until they either succeed or run out of attempts.<br>

**Challenge:** Add functionality to "reset" the password if the user runs out of attempts, prompting for a security question.

For a reflection, consider loop efficiency:

**When would it be better to use a while loop instead of a do-while loop, and vice versa?**
