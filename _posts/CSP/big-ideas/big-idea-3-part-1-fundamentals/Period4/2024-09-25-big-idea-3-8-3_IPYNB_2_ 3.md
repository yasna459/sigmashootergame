## Overview

For loops can be used to iterate through a list or to go through a range of numbers.
This can be very useful if you want to get each single element of a list or dictionary or even a string.
In some cases, a for loop and a while loop can both be used.

## Looping through a string with for loops


```python
for letter in "teststring":
    print(letter)
```

    t
    e
    s
    t
    s
    t
    r
    i
    n
    g



```python
%%js
for (let letter of "teststring") {
    console.log(letter);
}
```

t\
e\
s\
t\
s\
t\
r\
i\
n\
g

Code breakdown

- First, we create the for loop
- Then, we create a temporary variable. In this case, 'letter'
- Finally, we create a string to iterate through, 'teststring'
- Then, inside the for loop, we print/console.log the variable 'letter' for each iteration

# Popcorn Hack #3

I want you to create a for loop that iterates and prints out to the terminal the letters of your name

### Example


```python
name = "weston"

for letter in name:
    print(letter)
```

    w
    e
    s
    t
    o
    n
