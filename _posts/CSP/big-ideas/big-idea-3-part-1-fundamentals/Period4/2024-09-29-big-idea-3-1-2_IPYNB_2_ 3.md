## <span class="glow" style="font-family: Monospace;">Python Data Types! :3</span>

In Python there are several diffrent types of varriables, in this part of the lesson we will go over the most commonly used ones!

<span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #a2c6e0">Integers, strings, booleans, floats, and lists!</span>

### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Integers</span>

Integers are whole number such as -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2, to name a few!


```python
# Here is an example of an integer used as a variable

age = 15
height = 60
favorite_number = 8

print(age)
print(height)
print(favorite_number)
```

    15
    60
    8


### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Strings</span>

theres are chains of: words, numbers, or charecters, and they are placed in quotes. You can use either single quotes `' '` or double quotes `" "`, but use the same one for each string.


```python
#camel case (no underscore)
nameStatement = "My name is Nora"
print(nameStatement)

#snake case (underscore)
name_Statment = 'My name is Nora'
print(nameStatement)

#incorrect:
#name_Statment = 'My name is Nora"
```

    My name is Nora
    My name is Nora


### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Booleans</span>

Booleans are true or false statments.  They are used in conditional statments, making an action occur is something is true or false.


```python
#boolean
joanna_drinks_match = False

#boolean used in if then/conditional statments
if joanna_drinks_match == True: 
   print (1) 
else: 
   print (0) 
```

    0


### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Floats</span>

Floats are numbers containing decimals (the oposite of Integers)


```python
#heres an example of a float, constants follow upper snake case conventions
IMMUTABLE_PI = 3.14

print(IMMUTABLE_PI)
```

    3.14


### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Lists</span>
Lists are ordered items.  They can contain a mix of data types but most comonly are all the same data type.  Lists can contain integers, floats, strings, and more!

If you want to print or use a specific item in a list, refer to  it with `variable_name[itemnumber]`. Keep in mind that when counting, computers always start at 0, so using `1` will call the second item in the list


```python
#here an an example of a list of strings
grocery_list = ["apples","honey","almond milk","cereal"]

print(grocery_list[0])
print(grocery_list[1])
print(grocery_list[2])
print(grocery_list[3])
```

    apples
    honey
    almond milk
    cereal


### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Dictionaries in Python</span>

In this part of the lesson we will go over dictionaries in python and how to make them!

Dictionaries contain data structures and include and store key-value pairs. In the dictionary, there are specific values that associate with a unique key. This is useful since it makes it easier and efficient to define multiple related values, see the data and lookup specific values. 

Print or use a variable in a dictionary by first referring to the dictionary name and then the variable inside of it.


```python
personal_info = {
    "name": "Bob",
    "age": 78,
    "city": "Las Vegas"
}

print(personal_info["name"])
print(personal_info["age"])
print(personal_info["city"])
```

    Bob
    78
    Las Vegas


In this example, we define data and format it to show the attributes of a person and then print statements to put them together in an introduction. Printing data types often requires mixing types and formatting them correctly



```python
# Data types cell

# Variable names in Python typically follow snake_case 
friendly_greeting = "Hello"
my_name = "Bob Tastic"
my_age = 78

print("Print with concatenation")
print("Example 1: " + friendly_greeting + " " + my_name + ", I see you are " + str(my_age) + " years old.")

print()
print("Or you can use f-strings")
print(f"Example 2: {friendly_greeting} {my_name}, I see you are {my_age} years old.")

# 
print()
print("Or you can separate the variable in the print statement")
print("Example 3:", friendly_greeting, my_name, ", I see you are", my_age, "years old.")

```

    Print with concatenation
    Example 1: Hello Bob Tastic, I see you are 78 years old.
    
    Or you can use f-strings
    Example 2: Hello Bob Tastic, I see you are 78 years old.
    
    Or you can separate the variable in the print statement
    Example 3: Hello Bob Tastic , I see you are 78 years old.


In this example, we define same data with a dictionary


```python
# Data types cell using dictionary

# Dictionary definition 
info = {
    "greeting": "Hello",
    "name": "Bob Tastic",
    "age": 78
}

print("Concatenation")
print("Example 1: " + info["greeting"] + " " + info["name"] + ", I see you are " + str(info["age"]) + " years old.")

print()
print("F-strings")
print(f"Example 2: {info['greeting']} {info['name']}, I see you are {info['age']} years old.")

print()
print("Separate the variable in the print statement")
print("Example 3:", info["greeting"], info["name"], ", I see you are", info["age"], "years old.")
```

    Concatenation
    Example 1: Hello Bob Tastic, I see you are 78 years old.
    
    F-strings
    Example 2: Hello Bob Tastic, I see you are 78 years old.
    
    Separate the variable in the print statement
    Example 3: Hello Bob Tastic , I see you are 78 years old.

### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Addition versus Concatenation</span>

Operators like + produce different outcomes based on the different data types. +'s are usually used for numbers, but for characters it connects sequences in a process called concatenation. 


```python
# Addition of two integer variables

int1 = 3
int2 = 4
# Concatation between two non strings in a print statement will EVALUATE them.
print(int1 + int2)
print("Notice how they get ADDED together.")
print()

# Concatenation of two string variables

# Concatation between two strings in a print statement will CONNECT them.
string1 = "3"
string2 = "4"
print(string1 + string2) # 
print("Notice how this CONNECTS the variables")

# Print statements like the above can be used to EVALUATE the result of + on two variables
```

    7
    Notice how they get ADDED together.
    
    34
    Notice how this CONNECTS the variables
