## <span class="glow" style="font-family: Monospace;">JavaScript Data Types! :]</span>

In this lesson we will be reviewing how diffrent data types are used in JS!

##### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #a2c6e0">We will be reviewing: Integers/floats, strings, booleans, and arrays</span>

### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Integers and Floats</span>

In javascript vs python you do not have to define integers vs floats


```python
%%html

<script>
//here we define the number (temperature) and log it into the console!
temperature = 76;

console.log("number: ", temperature);
element.append("number: " + temperature);
</script>
```



<script>
//here we define the number (temperature) and log it into the console!
let temperature = 76;
console.log("number: ", temperature);
element.append("number: " + temperature);
</script>



### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Strings</span>

In JavaScript a string is used to represent text.  Strings are defined by closing a set of charecters in quotes (single or double but not both!)


```python
%%html

<script>
//here we define the string (fruit) and log it into the console!
let fruit = "mango";
let test = "test";
console.log("String: ", fruit);
element.append("String: " + fruit );
</script>
```



<script>
//here we define the string (fruit) and log it into the console!
let fruit = "mango";
let test = "test";
console.log("String: ", fruit);
element.append("String: " + fruit );
</script>



### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Booleans</span>

a boolean represents a true or false value, they are usually used in if then statments. Stating that if something is true/false, then something else will occour!


```python
%%html

<script>
//here we define the boolean (isSkyBlue) and log it into the console!
let isSkyBlue = true;
console.log("Boolean: ", isSkyBlue);
element.append("Boolean: " + isSkyBlue);

//if the sky is blue it will come up as true in the consle 
//if not it will say false!
</script>
```



<script>
//here we define the boolean (isSkyBlue) and log it into the console!
let isSkyBlue = true;
console.log("Boolean: ", isSkyBlue);
element.append("Boolean: " + isSkyBlue);

//if the sky is blue it will come up as true in the consle 
//if not it will say false!
</script>



### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Arrays</span>

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable!  all the values in an array are called elements,  these elements can be any diffrent data type!


```python
%%html

<script>
//here we create an array of strings (berries) and log it to the console!
let berries = ["strawberry", "blueberry", "raseberry", "blackberry"];
console.log("Array: ", berries);
element.append("Array: " + berries.join(", "));
</script>
```



<script>
//here we create an array of strings (berries) and log it to the console!
let berries = ["strawberry", "blueberry", "raseberry", "blackberry"];
console.log("Array: ", berries);
element.append("Array: " + berries.join(", "));
</script>



<span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #a2c6e0">`Popcorn Hack:` create your own array using two or more diffrent data types we throughout the lesson! </span>

### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Dictionaries (Objects)</span>

In Javascript, objects are like dictionaries, where the keys correspond with values. To access the data of an object, we can use dot notation or bracket notation.

##### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #a2c6e0">Example:</span>

For this specific example, we will declare an object and iterate through its key-value pairs.



```python
%%html

<script>
// Example of a JavaScript object (dictionary)
let studentInfo = {
  name: "Kushi Gade",
  age: 25,
  grade: 10,
  interests: ["Sleeping", "Reading", "Cooking"]
};


// Traversing the object using a for...in loop
for (let key in studentInfo) {
  console.log(key + ": " + studentInfo[key]); // Logs each key and its associated value
  element.append(key + ": " + studentInfo[key] + "<br>");
}
</script>
```



<script>
// Example of a JavaScript object (dictionary)
let studentInfo = {
  name: "Kushi Gade",
  age: 25,
  grade: 10,
  interests: ["Sleeping", "Reading", "Cooking"]
};


// Traversing the object using a for...in loop
for (let key in studentInfo) {
  console.log(key + ": " + studentInfo[key]); // Logs each key and its associated value
  element.append(key + ": " + studentInfo[key] + "<br>");
}
</script>



### <span style="font-family: Monospace; color: #6888fc">Addition and Concatenation</span>

We can also use addition and concatenation, just like in Python


```python
%%html

<script>
// Addition of two integer variables

let int1 = 3;
let int2 = 4;
// Concatenation between two non-strings in a print statement will EVALUATE them.
console.log(int1 + int2); // This will add the two numbers.
console.log("Notice how they get ADDED together.");
console.log();

// Concatenation of two string variables

let string1 = "3";
let string2 = "4";
// Concatenation between two strings in a print statement will CONNECT them.
console.log(string1 + string2); // This will concatenate (connect) the strings.
console.log("Notice how this CONNECTS the variables");
</script>

```



<script>
// Addition of two integer variables

let int1 = 3;
let int2 = 4;
// Concatenation between two non-strings in a print statement will EVALUATE them.
console.log(int1 + int2); // This will add the two numbers.
console.log("Notice how they get ADDED together.");
console.log();

// Concatenation of two string variables

let string1 = "3";
let string2 = "4";
// Concatenation between two strings in a print statement will CONNECT them.
console.log(string1 + string2); // This will concatenate (connect) the strings.
console.log("Notice how this CONNECTS the variables");
</script>



<style>
    .glow {
        color: #3634c7; /* Text color */
        text-shadow: 0 0 10px #3d238c, 0 0 20px #3d238c, 0 0 30px #3d238c; /* Glowing effect on text */
        transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
    }
</style>

## <span class="glow" style="font-family: Monospace;">Hack #2</span>

Create a average grade calculator using integers and addition.  input scores as variables, add them together, and average them out.  Using that data create an array of student info (ex: name/age) and average grade.


- choose either Js (using an array/object) or python (using a list)
- Use comments to explain your code and thought process.
- log your work/print with consle
