<h2><span class = "glow" style="font-family: Monospace; color:#ffffff">String Functions In Python</span></h2>

- more functions you can do on strings


```python
tiger_fact = "the stripes on a Tiger are unique, similar to the human fingerprint"


#make everything lowercase or uppercase, use .lower() or .upper()
print(tiger_fact.lower())
print(tiger_fact.upper())
```

    the stripes on a tiger are unique, similar to the human fingerprint
    THE STRIPES ON A TIGER ARE UNIQUE, SIMILAR TO THE HUMAN FINGERPRINT



```python
#count how many times an argument appears
#don't forget quotes
print(tiger_fact.count("the"))
```

    2



```python
#find a specific index
#index is the number of a character in a string
print(tiger_fact.find("unique"))
#27 means the letter "u" is the 27th character
```

    27



```python
#replace something in a string, there are 2 parts

#format: variable.replace('thing you want replaced', 'replacement')
tiger_fact.replace('Tiger', 'zebra')
#this will not work on it's own. To make it work, there are 2 options:

#option1: make new var 
new_tiger_fact = tiger_fact.replace('Tiger', 'zebra')
print(new_tiger_fact)

#option2: replace old var with new var
tiger_fact = tiger_fact.replace('Tiger', 'zebra')
print(tiger_fact)
```

    the stripes on a zebra are unique, similar to the human fingerprint
    the stripes on a zebra are unique, similar to the human fingerprint




<h4><span style="font-family: Monospace; color:#7077D7">Concat</span></h4>

- stands for concatinate
- join multiple variables together


```python
fish = "fish"
fish1 = "angel"
fish2 = "cat"
fish3 = "puffer"


bad_format_species = fish1 + fish + fish2 + fish + fish3 + fish
print(bad_format_species)
#you can also do this directly under print instead of making a new var

#to better format these fishes, add commas and spaces as separate strings in variable
good_format_species = fish1 + fish + ', ' + fish2 + fish + ', ' + fish3 + fish
print(good_format_species)
```

    angelfishcatfishpufferfish
    angelfish, catfish, pufferfish




<h5><span style="font-family: Monospace; color:#7077D7">Formatted string basics</span></h5>

- when you are concating a lot of variables, using plus signs and individual strings for spaces gets messy
- formatted strings make it easier to read and keep track of everything 
- use placeholders {} then replace them later on with .format()


```python
better_format_species = '{}{}, {}{}, and {}{} are my favorite fish!' .format(fish1,fish,fish2,fish,fish3,fish)
print(better_format_species)
```

    angelfish, catfish, and pufferfish, are my favorite fish!
