<h2><span class = "glow" style="font-family: Monospace; color:#ffffff">Strings in Javascript</span></h2>

- Strings are primitive data types/ immutable
    - parsed: data is stored directly in a variable (for basic storage)
    - this means they are unchanging
    - don't have properties and types
- formatted similar to python, using quotes (both single and double) and starting at 0


```python
%%js

console.log("simple way to display strings");
//console.log prints in console
//js lingo: what's inside source code is called string literal. What appears in the console is called String value.



//use variable to assign values of string 
//variables are better bc you can have spaces without a plus sign
const stringExample = "another example of printing a string";
console.log(stringExample);

//if string has an apostrophe and you're using single quotes, use backslash to negate apostrophe (same as python)
//you can also switch to double quotes
console.log("the dog said \"where is my food\" as the owner left");



//concat
const mascot = "night" + "hawk";
console.log(mascot);

//you can concat multiple variables together under a separate variable similar to in python
const fish1 = "pufferfish";
const fish2 = "marlin";
const fish3 = "salmon";
const favFish = "My favorite fish species are" + fish1 + ", " + fish2 + ", and" + fish3 ".";
console.log(favFish);


//template literal, uses backticks instead of quotes
//more convienent way to concat with diff syntax, not as messy
const favFishMethodTwo = `My favorite fish species are ${fish1}, ${fish2}, and ${fish3}.`;
console.log(favFishMethodTwo);
//can also be used to define strings without the worry of overlapping quotes
console.log(`I'm sure this is "correct"`);



//new lines with \n
const riddle = "my favorite animal\nhiberates during the winter\nin a cave";
console.log(riddle);

//for template literal, enter string in new line
const threeLines = `this is line one
this is line 2
this is line 3`;
console.log(threeLines);

```

<h4>Since strings can be treated as objects in JS, refer to <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String"><span class = "glow">this website</span></a> for a list of js methods</h4>
