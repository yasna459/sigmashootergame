<br>

Get the lyrics of a clean song to:
- find how many times the title of the song appears in the lyrics
- find the index of the 50th word
- replace the first verse with the last verse
- concat two verses together to make your own song

- Using JS:
    - concat a flower with an animal to make a new creature
        - use both quotes and backtick/ template literal to display this
    - set the new creature as a variable
    - write a short story about your creature using variables, multiple lines, dialog, and apostrophes. You can use either quotes or backtick

<style>
    .glow {
        color: #fff; /* Text color */
        text-shadow: 0 0 10px #8171E5, 0 0 20px #8171E5, 0 0 30px #8171E5; /* Glowing effect on text */
        transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
    }

## <span class ="glow">Main strings hack (20%)</span>
Using sections above...
1. Make a text analyzer with strings that accepts input from the user
    - Takes multiple words/ sentences
    - Displays original string
    - Counts total characters (includes spaces)
    - Displays longest word with how many characters it has
    - Displays the string reversed
    - Find middle word/ character (excludes spaces or special characters)
    - Correctly displays everything!
2. Other criteria:
    - make sure program can process upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
    - Customize and add your own unique function
    - Try to use both python and js, either making two separate analyzers or using both at the same time

3. Extra/ Bonus: make two additional input systems where user can replace words of the original input. 
    - The first input is which word they want to replace, the second is what to replace it with
    - For example, if they inputed a song verse, through the second input they can replace a specific word that repeats in the song with another
    - Make sure input can handle requests to change things that aren't in original string.
