## Step 1: Create a Dictionary

Create a dictionary called personal_info, and have it include "name", "email", "phone number".
They can be anything.

## Step 2: Print out the Dictionary:

Print out the entire Dictionary you made.

## Step 3: Print out the name from your dictionary:

Print out the name that you put in your dictionary. First print out "My Name is:", then print out the name.

## Step 4: Print the Length:

Print the Overall Length of the Dictionary using len()

## Step 5: Print the Type:

Print the Overall Type of the Dictionary using type()

## Bonus:

Add another dictionary with the same thing "name" "email" "phone number" and print their different values.

### Part 1: Create Personal Info (dict)
Create a dictionary called `personal_info` that includes the following keys. Assign values to the keys: `full_name`, `years`, `location`, and `favorite_food`. The `full_name` should be a string, `years` an integer, `location` a string, and `favorite_food` a string.

<details>
<summary>See Answer</summary>

```python
personal_info = {
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "years": 25,
    "location": "New York",
    "favorite_food": "Pizza"
}
```
</details>

### Part 2: Create a List of Activities (list)
Create a list called `activities` that includes three of your favorite activities as strings. Print the `activities` list.

<details>
<summary>See Answer</summary>

```python
activities = ["Running", "Reading", "Gaming"]
print(activities)
```
</details>

---

### Part 3: Add Activities to Personal Info (dict and list)
Add the `activities` list to the `personal_info` dictionary under the key `activities`. Print the updated `personal_info` dictionary.

<details>
<summary>See Answer</summary>

```python
personal_info["activities"] = activities
print(personal_info)
```
</details>

---

### Part 4: Check Availability of an Activity (bool)
Choose one of your activities and create a boolean variable called `activity_available`. Set `activity_available` to `True` if your activity is available today, otherwise set it to `False`. Print a message using `activity_available` like: "Is «your activity» available today? «True/False»"

<details>
<summary>See Answer</summary>

```python
activity_available = True  # or False
print(f"Is Running available today? {activity_available}")
```
</details>

---

### Part 5: Total Number of Activities (int)
Create a variable called `total_activities` and set it to the number of activities in your `activities` list. Print a message like: "I have «total_activities» activities."

<details>
<summary>See Answer</summary>

```python
total_activities = len(activities)
print(f"I have {total_activities} activities.")
```
</details>

---

### Part 6: Favorite Activities (tuple)
Create a tuple called `favorite_activities` that contains your two most favorite activities. Print the `favorite_activities` tuple.

<details>
<summary>See Answer</summary>

```python
favorite_activities = ("Running", "Reading")
print(favorite_activities)
```
</details>

---

### Part 7: Add a New Set of Skills (set)
Create a set called `skills` and add three unique skills you have. Print the set of `skills`.

<details>
<summary>See Answer</summary>

```python
skills = {"Coding", "Cooking", "Photography"}
print(skills)
```
</details>

---

### Part 8: Consider a New Skill (NoneType)
You are thinking about learning a new skill. Create a variable called `new_skill` and set it to `None` (you haven’t decided yet). Print the value of `new_skill`.

<details>
<summary>See Answer</summary>

```python
new_skill = None
print(new_skill)
```
</details>

---

### Part 9: Calculate Total Hobby and Skill Cost (float)
Assume each activity costs $5 to pursue and each skill costs $10 to develop. Create a variable called `total_cost` as a float, and calculate how much it would cost to develop all your activities and skills. Print the total cost.

<details>
<summary>See Answer</summary>

```python
total_cost = (len(activities) * 5) + (len(skills) * 10)
print(f"Total cost: ${total_cost}")
```

## Popcorn Hack 1 (SETS):

-Create a set called [Set1] of 3 numbers (can be any number)

-Create a set called [Set2] of different 3 numbers (can be any number)
-log both sets separately

-Add a number and Remove the 1st number from set1

-log the union of both Set1 and Set2.

## Popcorn Hack 2 (Dictionaries):

-Create a Dictionary called "application" that has someones "name", "age", "experiences", and "money".

-log the dictionary to make sure it works

-log only the dictionarie's money

## Homework Hack:

-Make an application for an applicant, ask them questions about their name, age, and experiences.
