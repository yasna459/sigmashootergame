Lists are similar to its name, it's a variable that equals a list of objects inside of it. For example, if I want to make a list of ingredients, I can make ingredients equal something inside these "[]". Inside these brackets, you can put different objects inside of it and print out the list to be able to get everything inside that list.

## Example:
list1 = ["Eggs", "Bacon", "rice"]
print(list1)

## Lists with Indexs:

If you want to print out specific parts inside that list, we can do that by printing out the index. From the index, it goes from index (0) -> index (1) -> index (2) -> etc.

For example, if I wanted to print out the words "eggs" only from a list, I would mention its index inside the list AND the list, and print it out:

## Example:
list1 = ["Eggs", "Bacon", "rice"]
print(list1[0])


## Getting Multiple Indexs In A List:
If you want to get multiple indexes from the same list without making multiple print statements/etc. you can use a ":" to scale it from the starting point, to how many objects it should contain. For example,

text[0:1] will only print out "EGG" because it gets index "0" and gets only ONE object

text[0:2] will print out "EGG", "BACON" because it gets index "0" and gets TWO objects

## Example:
list1 = ["Eggs", "Bacon", "rice"]
print(list1[0:2])

## Appends

(.append) is usually used to add something to a list, either in a specific part or just at the end of it. After the (.append) you use "()" and something inside of the parantheses to make something added to the list. For example:

list1 = ["Eggs", "Bacon", "rice"]
list1.append("served")

## Remove

(.remove) is used to remove something inside of a list. The formatting is similar to (.append) except it has to be inside the list it can't just be anything. For example:

list1 = ["Eggs", "Bacon", "rice"]
list1.remove("rice")

# Python:




```python
#MAIN LIST:

list1 = ["Eggs", "Bacon", "rice"]

#This prints out the ENTIRE list

print(list1)

#This prints out only one part of the list
#in this case, the list goes from 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> etc, so it'll print out "Bacon"

print(list1[1]) 

#This prints out 2 parts of the list
#in this case, the list goes from 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> etc, so it'll print out "eggs", "bacon"

print(list1[0:2]) 

#Appending a list, (Note: this affects the list entirely untill its removed):

list1.append("served")
print(list1)

#removing the "served" from the list

list1.remove(list1[3]) #You can also use indexes for these as well. Helpful especially if the name is long.
print(list1)
```

# Javascript version:

The javascript version is a bit different. It prints out the same properties, but the different commands are written differently, plus you need to have ";" at the end of everything.

## Changes in List:

The lists is mostly similar to the python code, except its "let x = ["a", "b", "c"]" instead of it being "x = ["a", "b", "c"]

## Changes in prints

The print statements just get changed from "print" to "console.log" so it prints it in the console instead of a python server.

## Multiple Indexes:

The code for multiple indexes is a bit different in javascript. Instead of using [0:2] you have to use a "slice" along with using paranthesses. For example:

let x = ["a", "b", "c"];
console.log(x.slice(0,2));

## Appending

For appending, you instead use ".push" instead of ".append"

## Removing

For removing, you use ".splice" with the index you want to move it in, and how many indexes you want to replace.

let x = ["a", "b", "c"]

x.push("d")
console.log(x)

x.splice(3, 1, "e") //This replaces "d" with "e"
console.log(x)

x.splice(3, 1) //This just removes "e"
console.log(x)

# Javascript:


```python
// MAIN LIST
let list1 = ["Eggs", "Bacon", "Rice"];

// This prints out the ENTIRE list
console.log(list1);

// This prints out only one part of the list
// In this case, the list goes from 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> etc., so it'll print out "Bacon"
console.log(list1[1]);

// This prints out 2 parts of the list
// In this case, it'll print out "Eggs", "Bacon"
console.log(list1.slice(0, 2)); // JavaScript slice() method extracts a portion of the array

// Appending a list (Note: this affects the list entirely until it's removed)
list1.push("Served");
console.log(list1);

// Removing "Served" from the list
list1.splice(3, 1); // Using index to remove element at position 3
console.log(list1);
```
