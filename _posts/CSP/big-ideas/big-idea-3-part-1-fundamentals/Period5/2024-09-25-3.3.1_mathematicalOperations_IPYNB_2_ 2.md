# **Important Terms :)**
 - Algorithm: A list of steps that occur in a specific order
 - Sequencing: Things are done in order
 - Flow chart: A way to write an algorithm; use arrows to tell the descision
 - Psuedo code: Fake code. It's verbal instructions and comments on what each section is doing

 ## **Continued Mathematical Operators**
 
This is kind of like your vocab list: 

- Addition: a + b
- Subtraction: a - b
- Multiplication: a * b
- Division: a / b
- Exponents: a ** b
- Modulus(remainder of a / b): a MOD b
    - MOD is %
- Floor division(rounds to the nearest whole number): 
    - In python a // b 
    - Javascript doesn't have an operator so use Math.floor(a / b)
- Math is in order of operations

### Some Examples: 
```python
first = 2
second = 4

print(first + second)    # Output is 6
print(first - second)    # Output is -2
print(second / first)     # Output is 2.0 (division returns a float)
print(first ** second)   # Output is 16 (2 raised to the power of 4)
```
