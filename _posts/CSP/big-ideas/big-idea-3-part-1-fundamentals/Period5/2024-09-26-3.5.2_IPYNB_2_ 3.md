## **Logical Operators**

These are used to test multiple conditions to produce a single Boolean value.

- AND(&& or "and"): Returns true if both conditions are true. If either condition is false or if both are false, it returns false.
- OR('| |' or "or"): Returns true if at least one condition is true. If both conditions are false, it returns false
- NOT(! or "not"): If the condition is false, then it returns true. If the condition is true, then it returns false.

# **More Hacks! (Both python and javascript)**


## Popcorn Hack 2: Temperature Check
Example 1: Going with a temperature example, use logical operators to test whether the temperature is comfortable or not. 

Javascript Version: 
```javascript
let temperature = 43;

// Boolean expressions
let comfortable = temperature < 83 && temperature > 63;
let notComfortable = temperature < 63 || temperature > 83;

if (comfortable) {
    console.log("It is a comfortable temperature");
} else if (notComfortable) {
    console.log("It is not a comfortable temperature");
}
```

Python Version: 
```python
## Example 1: Temperature Check
temperature = 43 

# Boolean expressions
comfortable = temperature < 83 and temperature > 63
not_comfortable = temperature < 63 or temperature > 83

if comfortable: 
    print("It is a comfortable temperature")
elif not_comfortable:
    print("It is not a comfortable temperature")
```


## Popcorn Hack 3: You want to test if someone is authorized to enter a building or not. 
Javascript Version: 
```javascript
// Define user status
let isAuthorized = false;  // Change this to true to test authorized access

// Use NOT to determine access
let canEnter = !isAuthorized;

// Output the result
console.log(canEnter ? "Access granted!" : "Access denied!");
```

Python Version: 
```python
# Define user status
is_authorized = False  # Change this to True to test authorized access

# Use NOT to determine access
can_enter = not is_authorized

# Output the result
print("Access granted!" if can_enter else "Access denied!")
```




# DeMorgan's Law 
De Morgan's Laws Explained:

Imagine you have two statements or conditions, like:

A: "It’s raining."
B: "I can play outside."

## First Law: 
¬(A∧B)=¬A∨¬B

What it Means: If I say, "It’s not true that it’s both raining and I can play outside," I'm saying at least one of these must be false.
Translation: This means either "It’s not raining" or "I can’t play outside."
So if I don’t want both things to happen together, it means one of them isn’t happening.

## Second Law: 
¬(A∨B)=¬A∧¬B
What it Means: If I say, "It’s not true that it’s either raining or I can play outside," that means both must be false.
Translation: This means "It’s not raining" and "I can’t play outside."
So if I don’t want either of those situations to happen, then both must not be happening.

Summary
In simple terms:

First Law: The statement "not (A and B)" is equivalent to saying "not A or not B," meaning at least one of the two must be false.

Second Law: The statement "not (A or B)" is equivalent to saying "not A and not B," meaning both must be false.

These laws help us understand how negation (saying "not") works with AND and OR in logic!

# **Homework Hacks**
1. All popcorn hacks (1-3) in both Javascript and Python. **If you copy paste from the examples, we WILL make you take a (different, much harder) quiz and grade it.**
2. OPTIONAL: Take this quiz(Use school email): [Quiz](https://forms.gle/HwSUrEtNfvbKHqyr9)
3. Create a truth table. A truth table typically lists all possible combinations of truth values (True and False) for a given number of variables and their corresponding outputs for various logical operations.
    Steps to Create a Truth Table 
        1. Identify the Variables: You would have 2 variables, A and B, representing True and False.
        2. Determine the Number of Rows: The number of rows is 2^n where n is the number of variables, so 4
        3. Write out all combinations of True (T) and False (F) for the variables.
        4. Add columns for Each Logical Expression:
        5. Create additional columns for the logical expressions you want to evaluate.
        6. Calculate the Results: Evaluate the logical expressions for each combination of variable values and fill in the table.

Truth table example:
        

|A|B| A AND B | A OR B |
|-|-|---------|--------|
|0|0|    0    |   0    |
|0|1|    0    |   1    |
|1|0|    0    |   1    |
|1|1|    1    |   1    ||

# Grading 
Use this rubric to grade. Ratio is 1-4

** 4+ - top work, something beyond what was required, 1 to 2 per class (95%)	

** 4 - performed 98% to 100% of requirements, majority should be .9  (89% to 92%)	

** 3 - missing some key elements, 80% to 85%			

** 2 - missing many to most key elements, 70%			

** 1 - no work, 55%			

** 0 - copying or not understand work performed, 0%			

| **Name**                | **Weightage** | **Grade** |
|-------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Hack 1                  | 15%           |           |
| Hack 2                  | 15%            |           |
| Hack 3                  | 15%           |           |
| Homework                | 55%           |           |
