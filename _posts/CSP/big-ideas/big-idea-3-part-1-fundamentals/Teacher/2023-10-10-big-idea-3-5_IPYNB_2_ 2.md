# Boolean

- A Boolean value is either true or false.
- A Boolean expression produces a Boolean value (true or false) when evaluated.

## <mark><b>Relational operators:</b></mark> 
- Used to test the relationship between 2 variables, expressions, or values. These relational operators are used for comparisons and they evaluate to a Boolean value (true or false).

<b>Ex.</b> a == b evaluates to true if a and b are equal, otherwise evaluates to false

- a == b (equals)	
- a != b (not equal to)
- a > b (greater than)
- a < b (less than)
- a >= b (greater than or equal to)
- a <= b (less than or equal to)

<b>Example:</b> The legal age to work in California is 14 years old. How would we write a Boolean expression to check if someone is at least 14 years old?

age >= 14

- In most states, the minimum age to drive is 16. How would we write a boolean expression to check if someone is at least 16 years old?
```python
age >= 16
```
- Write a boolean expression to check if the average of grade1, grade2, and grade3 is at least 70. 
```python
(grade1 + grade2 + grade3)/3 >= 70
```
- Write a code to check if the temperature is less than 90 degrees
```python
temp < 90
```

## <mark><b>Logical operators:</b></mark>
Used to evaluate multiple conditions to produce a single Boolean value.

- <b>NOT</b>	evaluates to true if condition is false, otherwise evaluates to false
- <b>AND</b>	evaluates to true if both conditions are true, otherwise evaluates to false
- <b>OR</b>	evaluates to true if either condition is true or if both conditions are true, otherwise evaluates to false

<b>Example:</b> You win the game if you score at least 10 points and have 5 lives left or if you score at least 50 points and have more than 0 lives left. Write the Boolean expression for this scenario.

(score >= 10 AND lives == 5) OR (score == 50 AND lives > 0)

<b>Example:</b> Write a Boolean expression to check if the average of height1, height2, and height3 is at least 65 inches.

(height1 + height2 + height3) / 3 >= 65

## Hacks
Review each of the sections above and produce ...
1. Look up De Morgan's Law. What is it, and how can it apply to your code? Make a blog post about it.
2. Create a truth table using Python (hint: These tables come up during the AP Exam). You will need to use libraries such as itertools. Here is an image of how the truth table should look:
