## Nested Conditionals



## Introduction

**Nested conditionalsare a fundamental concept in programming where one conditional statement is placed inside another. This allows for more complex decision-making processes and enables programs to handle a wider range of scenarios.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. **Understand what nested conditionals are.**
2. **Write pseudocode using nested conditionals.**
3. **Apply nested conditionals to solve problems.**

## Key Concepts

1. `Conditional Statements`: Used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
2. `Nested Conditionals`: A conditional statement inside another conditional statement.

## Example Syntax (College Board Pseudocode)

College Board pseudocode uses the following structure for conditional statements:

```plaintext
IF condition1
{
    // Code block for condition1
    IF condition2
    {
        // Code block for condition2
    }
    ELSE
    {
        // Code block if condition2 is false
    }
}
ELSE
{
    // Code block if condition1 is false
}


`Example 1: Checking Grade Categories`

## Pseudocode
Let's write a pseudocode to determine the grade category based on a score:


```python
IF score >= 90
{
    DISPLAY "A"
}
ELSE
{
    IF score >= 80
    {
        DISPLAY "B"
    }
    ELSE
    {
        IF score >= 70
        {
            DISPLAY "C"
        }
        ELSE
        {
            IF score >= 60
            {
                DISPLAY "D"
            }
            ELSE
            {
                DISPLAY "F"
            }
        }
    }
}

```

## Python
Here is the equivalent Python code:


```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("A")
else:
    if score >= 80:
        print("B")
    else:
        if score >= 70:
            print("C")
        else:
            if score >= 60:
                print("D")
            else:
                print("F")

```

`Example 2: Determining Eligibility for a Loan`


## Pseudocode
Let's consider a scenario where we determine if a person is eligible for a loan based on their credit score and income:


```python
IF credit_score >= 700
{
    IF income >= 50000
    {
        DISPLAY "Eligible for loan"
    }
    ELSE
    {
        DISPLAY "Not eligible for loan due to low income"
    }
}
ELSE
{
    DISPLAY "Not eligible for loan due to low credit score"
}

```

## Python
Here is the equivalent Python code:




```python
credit_score = 750
income = 60000

if credit_score >= 700:
    if income >= 50000:
        print("Eligible for loan")
    else:
        print("Not eligible for loan due to low income")
else:
    print("Not eligible for loan due to low credit score")

```

`Example 3`
Write pseudocode to determine if a person qualifies for a discount based on their membership status and purchase amount:

If the person is a member:
  - If the purchase amount is greater than $100, they get a 20% discount.
  - Otherwise, they get a 10% discount.
If the person is not a member:
   - If the purchase amount is greater than $100, they get a 5% discount.
    - Otherwise, they get no discount.



```python
IF is_member = TRUE
{
    IF purchase_amount > 100
    {
        DISPLAY "20% discount"
    }
    ELSE
    {
        DISPLAY "10% discount"
    }
}
ELSE
{
    IF purchase_amount > 100
    {
        DISPLAY "5% discount"
    }
    ELSE
    {
        DISPLAY "No discount"
    }
}

```

## Hacks
Review each of the sections above and produce ...

- Write pseudocode to determine if a student passes a class based on their exam scores and attendance using nested conditionals.
- Write a python segment  to decide the shipping cost based on the weight of a package and the delivery speed chosen (standard or express) using nested conditionals.
