### Text Representation Walk-through

1. **GitHub Pages (Frontend)**:
   - **Design, Layout**: The frontend is hosted on GitHub Pages, where the design and layout are defined.
   - **User Presentation, Style**: This layer is responsible for presenting the user interface and applying styles.

2. **JavaScript (Logic/Events)**:
   - **JS Functionality, Interactivity**: JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity to the frontend.
   - **Sends API Request**: When a user interacts with the frontend, JavaScript sends an API request to the backend.

3. **Python / Flask (Backend)**:
   - **Python Server-Side API Processing**: The Flask backend processes the API requests sent from the frontend.
   - **Communicate with Data Services**: The backend communicates with data services to fetch or store data.
   - **Replies with Response**: After processing the request, the backend sends a response back to the frontend.

4. **SQL Alchemy (Store Data)**:
   - **Store Data**: SQL Alchemy is used to interact with the database, storing and retrieving data as needed.


## Using Postman

Postman is a powerful tool for testing APIs. It allows developers to send HTTP requests to their APIs, inspect responses, and automate testing. Here are some key points and steps to guide your discussion on Postman:

1. **Postman Concepts**:
   - Postman can be used to test individual endpoints of the backend API without needing the frontend to be fully developed.
   - This allows developers to ensure that the backend logic is working correctly before integrating it with the frontend.

2. **Backend / Frontend are independent until Integration**:
   - Developers can verify that each API endpoint behaves as expected, which simplifies debugging and ensures that the backend is robust before integration with the frontend.
   - Postman can help in designing and documenting APIs.
     - By defining the expected inputs and outputs for each endpoint, developers can establish clear requirements for the frontend.
     - This ensures that both frontend and backend teams are aligned on the API specifications.

4. **Postman Demo**:

### Demonstration Steps

1. **Open Postman**:
   - Launch the Postman application on your computer.

2. **Create a New Request**:
   - Click on the "New" button and select "Request".
   - Enter a name for your request and choose a collection to save it in.

3. **Set the Request Method and URL**:
   - Select the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from the dropdown menu.
   - Enter the URL of the API endpoint you want to test (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8087/api/jokes`).

4. **Add Request Body (for POST/PUT requests)**:
   - If you are sending data to the server (e.g., for a POST or PUT request), add the request body in the "Body" tab.
   - Select the appropriate format (e.g., JSON) and enter the data.

5. **Send the Request**:
   - Click the "Send" button to send the request to the server.

6. **Inspect the Response**:
   - Review the response returned by the server in the "Response" section.
   - Check the status code, headers, and body to ensure that the API is behaving as expected.

7. **Save the Request**:
   - Save the request in a collection for future use and documentation.

### Summary

- **Testing Frontend in Different Parts**: Use Postman to test individual backend endpoints.
- **Independent Testing**: Verify backend functionality independently before integration.
- **API Design and Documentation**: Use Postman to design and document APIs, establishing clear requirements for the frontend.
- **Demonstration**: Follow the steps to create, send, and inspect requests using Postman.


### Flocker Authenticate through Postman

Here’s how you can use Postman to authenticate users:

Request type `POST`
Endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8887/api/authenticate`

To authenticate different users, you need to send the appropriate JSON payload in the body of the request. i

Here are examples for different users:
Payload in Body-Raw-JSON 
    Toby: `{"uid": "toby", "password": "123Toby!"}`
    Hop: `http://127.0.0.1:8887/api/authenticate`
    Niko: `{"uid": "niko", "password": "123niko"}`


### Flocker GET requests through Postman

Testing your APIs using Postman will save time!  It will help you determine if backend is working prior to defining frontend.  This enables you to split the work between people or debug backend prior to completing frontend work.

Request type `GET`

Obtain list of Users
Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8887/api/users`

Obtain list of posts for logged in user.  This should change depending on cookies.
Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8887/api/post`

Obtain a list of sections (aka communities) in flocker.
Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8887/api/section`

Obtain a list of groups (aka sub communities) in flocker.
Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8887/api/group`



## Running Deployed Frontend / Backend `https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/flocker_frontend/`

## Backend API

The code for API endpoints is located in the [flocker_backend repository](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flocker_backend/tree/main/api). Key files include `post.py`, `section.py`, and `group.py`. The API is registered in the root `main.py` file.

### Key Points

- **View in VSCode**: It's best to view these files in VSCode.
- **Testing with Postman**: Use Postman and run `main.py` in debug mode to verify code performance.
- **Request Handling**: These files handle `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests from the frontend.
- **RESTful Responses**: Methods provide RESTful responses containing JSON and status codes (e.g., 200, 500).

## Backend Model

The code for model (database) definitions is located in the [flocker_backend repository](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flocker_backend/tree/main/model). Key files include `post.py`, `section.py`, and `group.py`. The model is included in the root `main.py` file.

### Key Points

- **View in VSCode**: It's best to view these files in VSCode.
- **Accessed by API Files**: These model files are accessed by the corresponding API files.
- **Initialization Functions**: Initialization functions at the bottom of these files set up test data.
- **Run Initialization**: The initialization functions are run by the `scripts/db_init.py` script.
- **CRUD Operations**: APIs and init scripts perform CRUD operations on the SQLite database `instance/volumes/user_management.db`.  Use SQLite3 viewer to observe change.
