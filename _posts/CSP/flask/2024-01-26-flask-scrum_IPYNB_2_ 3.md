## Scrum Work
In the Agile methodology, Scrum is a framework that is used to implement Agile development. Scrum is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one. The Scrum process is adaptable to elements like group size, time of sprints, and tools used to guide the process.

- Group size in our Scrums starts at 6 people, but depending on the the project and Teacher direction we have gone to sizes of 12, the whole class, and have spanned across multiple classes.
- Sprints are shown in Classroom planning.  These typically have elements like checkpoints, showcases, demos, and live reviews.
- The Key tools are Issues, Scrum Boards, Repositories.  We center our Scrum on the GitHub tool chain.  These tools are used to share plans, share code, and derive analytics on participation.
