## Kasm Workspaces Development
This Kasm workspaces project is intended to produce a Cloud Desktop environment with tools to meet the student's development needs.  Kasm workspaces are dependent on AWS EC2 servers that are installed to support Kasm's Container streaming technology.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
--------------------------------------
Code -> Build Docker Images (w/tag) -> Push to DockerHub -> Test Kasm Container
```


## Kasm Workspaces SDLC
The Developer iterates through the actions that follow.  Be aware to look ahead as time of jobs, size of images, and tags of images can cause frustrations and challenges.

### 1. `Code` in dockerfile-* and in src directory
    - add code for new tools
    - add support files to src/ubuntu/install, check [Kasm](https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-images.git)

### 2. `Build` the dockerfile-* file
Commands

```bash
# clean up docker often, before a new run is best
docker image prune
# tag name needs to match your docker hub setup, see below, latest could be :1.0 for specific verion
docker build -t nighthawkcoders/kasm_workspaces:latest -f dockerfile-csse-nighthawk-ubuntu-jammy-desktop .
````

Logging

```bash
# This can take a long time "20 minutes", see time!!!

### 3. `Push` to dockerhub
Commands

```bash
# Setup your dockerhub by registering account through docker.io.  This is like GitHub, the public repositories are free.
docker login
# if you name is wrong, you can rename it to match: docker tag devops/csse-kasm-workspaces:latest:1.0 nighthawkcoders/kasm_workspaces:latest
# Tag names need to match the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nighthawkcoders/kasm_workspaces/general).
docker push nighthawkcoders/kasm_workspaces:latest
```

Logging

```bash
# This can take a long time "hours if highly customized", but seems to recover from interupts, see log
# Note, screen saver causes job to pause
The push refers to repository [docker.io/nighthawkcoders/kasm_workspaces]

#### 4. `Test` on Kasm
- [Registry setup](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/kasm_registry/tree/1.0/workspaces/CSSE-Ubuntu-Jammy)
- Goto Kasm Sever (aka kasm.nighthawkcodingsociety.com), login admin@kasm.local.   Select from the left panel "Workspace", then "Workspace Registry".  "Add new" registry if "Del Norte HS Computer Science" is not found. Obtain the Registry Link [here](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/kasm_registry).
- Click on small icons and install "Available Workspace".  This can take some time!!!
- At the top of the screen select "WORKSPACES" and then install workspace from the registry () is required for the pushed image to be visible on the Kasm workspaces admin panel
- run workplace
