Solving Derivatives
Everybody knows
Finding rates of change, positive when it grows
I don't know no nothing bout no L'Hop I just solve
40 something milli u-subs or so ive been told

finding y prime solve it into final form
they give ln thats just one over the x
i went from derivatives to integrals and floor()
calcs a fight but trust im ready to derive 
woooooooaooaoaoah
this is how the function grows
woooaooaooahah 
i guess this is how the work is shown

from to d to the y 
over d to the x
thats y prime; integrate
always +C when i solve

see i believe to find all of the concave parts
first and second; grades are reaching for the stars
