       - grid-container and grid-item are referenced the code 
    */

        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr)); /* Dynamic columns */

    }
    .grid-item p {
        margin: 5px 0; /* Add some margin for spacing */

    .image-gallery {

        overflow-x: auto;

<!-- This grid_container class is used by CSS styling and the id is used by JavaScript connection -->
<div class="grid-container" id="grid_container">
    <!-- content will be added here by JavaScript -->
</div>

<script>
    // 1. Make a connection to the HTML container defined in the HTML div
    var container = document.getElementById("grid_container"); // This container connects to the HTML div

    // 2. Define a JavaScript object for our http source and our data rows for the Living in the World grid
    var http_source = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/";
    var living_in_the_world = [
        {"flag": "0/01/Flag_of_California.svg", "greeting": "Hey", "description": "California - forever"},

    // 3a. Consider how to update style count for size of container
    // The grid-template-columns has been defined as dynamic with auto-fill and minmax

    // 3b. Build grid items inside of our container for each row of data

### Culture, Family, and Fun

Everything for me, as for many others, revolves around family and faith. Oh, to stay in context of this site ... don't forget I like code, code, coding.

- My mother told me that I was Danish, English. and Irish, here is my researched [family tree]({{site.baseurl}}/images/about/familytree.png)
- My family is pretty big as I have been married twice, my 1st wife passed away.  We have had 5 kids, 4 adopted by me, 1 biological.  Plus, there are three grandkids.  My name to my grandkids is Abuilito.
- The gallery of pics has some of my family, fun, culture and faith memories.
