### 1. Frontend: Student Registration & Backend: Business Logic

#### Systems

- Frontend [ncs.github.io](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/duallogin)
- Backend [flask2025.ncs.com](https://flask2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/login?next=/users/table2)

#### Overview

- **Frontend/Web Form**: A GitHub Pages web application is used to gather required user information and send user data to the Python/Flask backend.
- **Backend/Database**: The data sent from the web application is stored in AWS RDS (Amazon Web Services Relational Database Service) using SQL connection services.
- **Business Logic**: The Python/Flask backend, upon successful save, sends user information via an API to enable access to KASM Workspaces.

#### Users in KASM Workspaces

### 2. KASM MultiServer

KASM presents workspaces to the user. Upon request by the user to launch a workspace session, KASM supplies an AWS computing resource and streams a session of that workspace to the user's browser. In the Del Norte Computer Science classrooms, the customized workspace contains Visual Studio Code and support for coding languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript.

#### Infrastructure Management

To provide the KASM MultiServer features, KASM requires servers and agents. The Web Server, Database Server, and Connection Server manage KASM resources. These servers are the heart of KASM and need to be set up to enable MultiServer capabilities.

To configure these servers, Nighthawk developers have created tools and utilities to spin up these KASM servers.

- **Shell Programming**: Scripts that simplify and drive the setup process.
- **Terraform**: A tool that specializes in creating and sizing AWS servers.
- **Ansible**: A tool that specializes in the configuration management of servers. This is used to make the AWS servers into KASM workers.

### 3. KASM UI

#### KASM User UI

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/kasm_design/kasm_desktop.png" alt="Kasm workspace in Browser">

#### KASM Admin UI

Workspaces and the extensive Workspace Registry are key components of the KASM system. Activating a workspace is where the user's work begins.

Workspaces are developed according to the classroom's needs and then presented to users within the system. The UI allows for limiting usage according to groups.

Essentially, this is like installing all the necessary tools on a single user's laptop and then propagating that configuration and settings to every other user in the room.

#### Workspaces Links

- KASM Admin UI [kasm.ncs.com](https://kasm.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/):
- Del Norte Registry [ncs.com/registry](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/kasm_registry/1.0/)
- DockerHub [docker/ncs/pusd](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nighthawkcoders/pusd-student-ubuntu/general)
- GitHub CompSci Template [github/kasm-ubuntu](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/Kasm-Ubuntu22.04-Image-Template)

#### Workspace Registry

KASM provides ready made workspaces that can be used directly or as a template for your spcific customizations.  In Del Norte CompSci, we have customized on top of a KASM provided template.  The customizations were to meet tools and configurations that were not provided directly by KASM.

This illustration shows some of the A's through D's available in the KASM registry.  Also, contained in the registry is one of Del Norte CompSci's customizations.

### Costs

A projected cost comparison of the AWS/KASM solution versus traditional classroom fixed workstation costs. This comparison ignores some risks/changes:

1. Consulting services for KASM sizing and planning.
2. IT job skills changing from multiple site "Desktop Technicians" to a centralized cloud "DevOps Engineer".
3. Size of monitor, assuming a Chromebook is sufficient.
4. This study is based on a 1/5 usage ratio, or approximately 40 out of 200 CompSci students using AWS KASM Workspaces. Del Norte HS CompSci students are encouraged to set up and use their own computers. However, the predominantly 9th/10th grade classroom has 20 to 30 students using AWS KASM Workspaces.

#### AWS Costs (AWS Cloud Compute)

AWS costs using Single User system to current Multi User system.  Summer costs were a result of ongoing Development.

#### Usage Patterns (3 Weeks of Data)

It is easy for a teacher or program administrator to see if students are making use of available resources. By putting activities into the cloud, data insights are now at our fingertips.

1. Elementary and middle school labs are now online and utilized when needed, eliminating idle labs.
2. Concurrent usage may require scheduling lab days, optimizing the use of cloud-based concurrent licenses.
3. Homework capability is always available, providing the same experience at home as at school without the need for specialized desktop/laptop software.
